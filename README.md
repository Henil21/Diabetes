# Diabetes

This is a diabetes prediction model that uses machine learning to predict whether a person is likely to have diabetes or not based on certain features. The model is trained on a dataset of various features such as age, BMI, blood pressure, and glucose level to predict the likelihood of having diabetes.

The model used in this project is a binary classification model built using the Tensorflow library in Python. The model is trained on the dataset using  such as Logistic Regression.
